	<p>I was born and raised in the small town of <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California">
  Morro Bay</a> (pictured below) on the Central Coast of California. After completing high school, I attended the 
  <a href="https://engineering.iit.edu/bme">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> for my undergraduate education in biomedical 
  engineering. During that time, I spent 6 months studying abroad at the <a href="http://www.etsit.upm.es/index.php/en/">School of 
  Telecommunications Engineering (ETSIT)</a> at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) in Spain. After obtaining my bachelor's
  degree, I entered the biomedical engineering Ph.D. program  at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>

  Outside of research, I enjoy playing and listening to music, cooking, practicing hot yoga, and dancing. 
  For my first two years of grad school, I was a member of the UM All-Female Bollywood Fusion team, 
  <a href"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txUnqYWXJ5E">Michigan TAAL</a>, and now I practice ballet dance. 
  I also served as Co-President of the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Council which plans academic/professional and social 
  events for the graduate student of the department. I have taken up running for the past five years, and completed the Chicago 
  Marathon in October 2014 and the New York City Marathon in November 2016. </p>
