  I was born and raised in the small town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California" target="_blank">
  Morro Bay</a> on the Central Coast of California. After completing high school, I attended the 
  <a href="https://engineering.iit.edu/bme" target="_blank">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> for my undergraduate education in 
  biomedical engineering. During that time, I spent 6 months studying abroad at the 
  <a href="http://www.etsit.upm.es/index.php/en/" target="_blank">School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSIT)</a> at the 
  Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) in Spain. After obtaining my bachelor's degree, I entered the biomedical engineering 
  Ph.D. program  at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I obtained two master's degrees in biomedical and electrical
  engineering while conducting my Ph.D. research on RF pulse design for MRI. Upon defending my Ph.D. in September 2018, I 
  moved to Glasgow, Scotland where I began as a post-doctoral researcher working on parallel transmit 7 tesla MRI at the 
  <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/mvls/ice/" target="_blank">Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE)</a> of the University 
  of Glasgow.</p>

  Outside of research, I enjoy playing and listening to music, cooking, practicing hot yoga, dancing, running, and taking part
  in the weekly pub quiz with co-workers. For my first two years of grad school, I was a member of the UM All-Female Bollywood Fusion team, 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txUnqYWXJ5E" target="_blank">Michigan TAAL</a>, and now I practice ballet and contemporary
  dance at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0GbmAl5U8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank"> Dance Glasgow</a>. 
  I also enjoy running distance races non-competitively, and completed the Chicago Marathon in October 2014 and the New York City 
  Marathon in November 2016 along with a handful of half marathons. </p>
