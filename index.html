	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sydney Williams</h1>
	<p class="text-justify">I am lecturer in MRI physics at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/mvls/ice/" target="_blank">
	Imaging Centre of Excellence</a> of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher with
	<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/davidporter/" target="_blank">David Porter</a>.
	My main research focus is parallel transmission (pTx) RF pulse design for ultra-high field MRI. You can learn a bit more
	about how MRI works in my recent public engagement talk at the 2021 Glasgow Explorathon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCB61a2ZvM&t=52s" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
	
	<p class="text-justify">Before moving to Glasgow in 2018, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan. 
	I worked in the fMRI Lab and was co-advised by <a href="http://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Douglas Noll</a> and 
	<a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Fessler</a>. My thesis titled "Constrained and 
	Spectral-Spatial RF Pulse Design for Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be found
