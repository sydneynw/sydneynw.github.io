	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sydney Williams</h1>
	<p class="text-justify">I am currently a post-doctoral research assistant at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/mvls/ice/" target="_blank">
	Imaging Centre for Excellence</a> of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, and I am supervised by
	<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/davidporter/" target="_blank">David Porter</a>.
		My main research focus is parallel transmit RF pulse design for ultra-high field MRI. </p>
	
	<p class="text-justify">Before this, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan. 
	I worked in the fMRI Lab and was co-advised by <a href="http://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Douglas Noll</a> and 
	<a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Fessler</a>. My thesis titled "Constrained and 
	Spectral-Spatial RF Pulse Design for Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be found
