	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sydney Williams</h1>
	<p>I am currently a post-doctoral research assistant at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/mvls/ice/">
	Imaging Centre for Excellence</a> of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. My main research focus is parallel transmit
	RF pulse design for ultra-high field MRI. 
	
	<p>Before this, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan. 
	I worked in the fMRI Lab and was co-advised by <a href="http://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu/">Douglas Noll</a> and 
	<a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/">Jeffrey Fessler</a>. My thesis titled "Constrained and Spectral-Spatial RF
	Pulse Design for Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be found
